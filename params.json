Add your sites domain to the Redirect URIs, this will also white list this domain in CORS.\r\n3. Copy your apps Client ID and Client secret\r\n4. OBS! There's currently a limit to new Open Platform apps restricting them from doing so called anonymous api calls, to enable this please email [open@getnarrative.com](mailto://open@getnarrative.com) and ask to get your app enabled.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n---\r\n\r\nGrap the UUID for the moment you want to display, it's the last part of a shared moment link.
